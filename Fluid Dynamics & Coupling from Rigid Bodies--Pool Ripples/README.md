# Fluid Dynamics & Coupling from Rigid Bodies -- Pool Ripples

* Firstly, this is a discrete method to simulate the changes and movement of 2.5D water.
* It is based on the Shallow Wave Equation to solve the basic movement.
* And considering that the the range of the water is limited, the Neumann Boundary is slected to meet boundary     conditions.
* Of course, the Volume Perservation is also included to make the result look more real.
* What's more, the method of Virtual Height is involved to implement the influence from blocks to water.
